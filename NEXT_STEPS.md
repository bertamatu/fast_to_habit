## üìã What You Need to Do Now

### Option 1: Add Colors to Xcode (15 minutes)

**Follow these steps:**

1. Open `FastToHabit.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Navigate to `Assets.xcassets`
3. Open `COLOR_SETUP_GUIDE.md` (in project root)
4. Create 24 color sets following the guide
5. Build and run to verify

**Why do this?**
- Enables all custom colors in components
- Makes the app look professional
- Components will use your brand colors

---

### Option 2: Skip Colors for Now

The app will build and run fine without custom colors:
- Components use system colors (blue, gray, etc.)
- You can add colors later anytime
- Focus on building features first
